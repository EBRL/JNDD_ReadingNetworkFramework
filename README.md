This repository contains supplementary data and details for the analyses presented in this paper. Data is organized into folders based on the figures / analysis performed. Many of the analyses are based on publicly available datasets, the details of which can be found below. 

### Fig1_Yeo-to-NeuroSynth

- NeuroSynth "reading" activation likelihood maps (Yarkoni et al., 2011)  
- 7-network resting-state parcellation (Yeo et al., 2011)

### Fig2_Network-Predicts-Reading

- Modularity arrays
- Demographic / reading data

### Fig3_Dyslexia-vs-Hubness

- **Bailey2017_ROI-by-DYS.xlsx**: Node list including hub measures and whether it was implicated in dyslexia. Base file (264 nodes and network measures) is drawn from [Table S2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3838673/#SMtitle) of [Evidence for hubs in human functional brain networks](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.neuron.2013.07.035)
- **Dyslexia_Meta-Analytic-Results.xlsx**: Spreadsheet containing the original tables from the three meta-analyses used in the study. One study per sheet. Includes:
	- Tables 5 and 7 of [Maisog et al., 2008](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1196/annals.1416.024/full)
	- Table 2 of [Richlan et al., 2009](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.20752/full)
